/// Defines a contract for an entity that supports soft deletion.

/// <remarks>
/// This contract is used to allow soft deletion functionality for entities, where an entity is marked 
/// as deleted but remains in the database. It also enables the use of generic methods in shared 
/// repositories, where a type constraint is needed to access the deletion status properties.
/// </remarks>
/// <typeparam name="TKey">The type of the unique identifier for the entity, which must implement 
/// <see cref="System.IEquatable{TKey}"/> for proper equality checks in deletion operations.</typeparam>
